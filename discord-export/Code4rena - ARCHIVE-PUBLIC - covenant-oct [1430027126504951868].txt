🔎 **Got audit-related questions? Here's your roadmap** 

Find the information you need efficiently:

1. Step 1: **Review project documentation** in the audit repo. [Join the audit](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-10-covenant) for access.

2. Step 2: Use **🤖 Docs Wolf,** C4's documentation bot assistant. Open a private thread, tag `@Docs Wolf`, and ask your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  

*ℹ️  Note: Docs Wolf will be available within the next 24 hours.  We'll post an update once it's ready.*

3. Step 3: If you still need clarification after reviewing the docs, feel free to **ask the Covenant team** directly. From [the audit page](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-10-covenant), join the audit and select the `Q & A` tab.

To ensure sponsors can focus their time on questions that truly need their expertise, please: 

- Reference what you've already checked in the docs
- Be specific about what you need clarified
- Use thread replies to keep discussions organized

Good hunting!

GM @🐺Wardens - a few people reported problems compiling the code in the audit repo. We have pushed a fix that should address the issues. If you continue to experience problems, please alert staff in the #🐺・wardens channel. Thank you!
